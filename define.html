          <h2>Defining Social Class</h2>
          <p>
            Race is still a big factor in todayâ€™s society and it is displayed in
            the film industry in the United States. Social class or social
            division is often defined as the different status of wealth an
            individual has in life. The richer and more luxurious the lifestyle
            the higher you are in society.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, instead of displaying the lifestyle of the wealthy and
            upper-class Americans, West Side Story (1961) focuses on the lower
            class members of society such as those who are immigrants like the
            Sharks gang which consist of all Puerto Rican members who immigrated
            to America and those who come from a corrupted household which is
            the Jets gang consisting of all White American members. Although
            many people argue that race does not determine our status in
            America, the film reveals the unfair conduct of immigrants from two
            different perspectives. West Side Story (1961) outlines the racial
            treatments immigrants face in America, particularly people of color,
            which leads to a lack of opportunities for them, and as a result, a
            social class is created.
