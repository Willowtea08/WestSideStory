          <h2>Introduction to Musical</h2>
          <p>
            "West Side Story" the iconic 1961 musical, is a timeless masterpiece
            that transcends generations. Directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert
            Wise, this cinematic adaptation of the Broadway hit by Leonard
            Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and Arthur Laurents brings to life the
            gripping tale of love and conflict on the mean streets of New York
            City. Set against a backdrop of rivalry between two youth gangs, the
            Jets and the Sharks, this unforgettable story explores themes of
            prejudice, identity, and the transformative power of love. With its
            memorable music, incredible choreography, and stellar performances,
            "West Side Story" has remained a cultural touchstone for over six
            decades, leaving an indelible mark on the world of musical theater
            and cinema.
