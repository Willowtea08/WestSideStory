## Project Overview
This project presents an analysis of social class as depicted in the 1961 musical film West Side Story. The webpage explores themes of race, immigration, and class struggles as highlighted through iconic scenes and songs from the film. The site uses interactive and multimedia elements to immerse users in key moments from the movie, such as the "America" and "Gee, Officer Krupke" scenes, providing a deeper understanding of the social commentary embedded within the film.
The webpage is designed to be both informative and visually engaging, incorporating animations and user-triggered events that guide the viewer through the analysis. The project aims to blend media with content to create a dynamic educational experience.

## Figma Design
Figma Design: https://www.figma.com/design/cPJw23nkg5E8OBuEsyiefT/Project-%231?node-id=0-1&t=XSIIafuTQS2uuEaA-1 
The layout was planned in Figma, starting with a wireframe to organize content sections like the header, navigation, main content area, and footer. Each page was structured to balance text with visual elements, such as images and embedded videos, ensuring a cohesive flow. Interactive features were sketched out during the design phase to ensure a user-friendly experience across all devices.

## Features Animations:
The page uses GSAP animations to create smooth transitions and fade-ins when the user loads the page. This enhances the visual appeal and adds subtle movement to make the experience more dynamic.

## Sound Effects:
Although there are no direct sound effects integrated, key scenes from the movie are embedded via YouTube videos, which include music and sound effects from West Side Story that enhance the storytelling and provide context.

## User-triggered Events:

The background color of the page changes dynamically based on the day of the week, providing a unique visual experience each day.
Users can also interact with video content, which plays important musical numbers related to the discussion of social class.

## Responsive Design:
The webpage is fully responsive, ensuring it adapts well to different screen sizes. On smaller devices like phones, the layout changes to a vertical stack, while on larger screens, videos and text are displayed side-by-side for a more immersive experience.

## Technologies Used
