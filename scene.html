              The first song/scene that I will be analyzing is the musical
              number "America" which was between the females and the male
              members of the Sharks gang. The females argue that life is free in
              America as compared to back home in Puerto Rico while the men
              argue that it is not free and wonderful unless you are white. One
              of the lyrics is “Buying on credit is so nice, One look at us and
              they charge twice”(“America”) which sheds light on the racism they
              faced simply because their skin color is not the typical light
              skin tone found in America.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this musical number, the characters sing with more emphasis on
              their Puerto Rican accent with flashy dance moves and a Hispanic
              musical style with guitar and Latin percussion. The females also
              argue about how coming to America gave them freedom and how there
              are more opportunities here while the men argue against them
              bringing up the racism they as Puerto Ricans face along with other
              negative things such as being considered as criminals and coming
              from a war-torn and poverty-driven place.

              Another look into social class through the white lens is found in
              the musical act "Gee, Officer Krumpe." All the members are wearing
              blue colored or brown plaid design suits whereas Riff and Ice are
              the only ones wearing yellow, possibly showing their position in
              the gang as the leader and the head of the gang. “Gee, Officer
              Krupke” lyrics are about how the Jets gang feels about the police
              officers and adult officials in their life and what caused them to
              form a gang.

              <br />
              <br />
              They reenact the song as a scene of being in a courtroom, acting
              as judges, police officers, and themselves as unwanted juvenile
              delinquents whose parents are drunk and always on drugs thus they
              never received affection or guidance in life. As the lyrics go
              “Our mothers all are junkies, Our fathers all are drunks. Golly
              Moses, naturally we're punks!”(“Gee, Officer Krupke”) indicating
              that they lived in a poor environment with no parental love from
              their parents and decided to get away from the bad influence and
              try to find a better way of living by joining the gang but were
              still labeled as socially sick or psychologically disturbed.
